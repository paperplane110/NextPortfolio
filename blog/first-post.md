Hi all, please allow me to introduce a brand new personal website framework: `NextPortfolio` !

After a weekend of hard working, the version 0.0.1 has been finally released.

When I start designing `NextPortfolio`, I just want to build a clean, simple and modern portfolio.
I browsed a lot of personal website, like [tobiasahlin](https://tobiasahlin.com/)'s (the UI/UX of `Minecraft`, `Spotify` and `Github`),
and [Pedro Duarte](https://ped.ro/)'s.

Finally, I choose to build a minimalism styled website with `Next.js` and `NextUI`, 
which is the edge of the code with many powerful features and beautiful components.

Now, I'm really exciting to show you the cool and decent features of `NextPortfolio`.
There are 6 links on the top navbar, which are the entrance of 5 pages and your github.
